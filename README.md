# hisrt_painting_python
This repository contains a Python program that uses the Turtle graphics library to create a dot painting. The program randomly selects colors from a predefined list and places dots in a grid pattern, creating an abstract piece of art. The project demonstrates the use of loops, color manipulation, and Turtle graphics in Python.
